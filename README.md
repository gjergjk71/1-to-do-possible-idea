## X Framework

 A framework that makes CRUD implementation on the front-end a work of configuration of fields.
 Providing a decent UI as a default but having the possibility to configure/re-custom-implement sub-components for specific needs.
 (Maybe have the possibility to build a page, decide you wanna eject from the framework and build upon it, so make it possible to convert your CRUD builder 
 to clean non-configurable code that you can continue developing as though you started it from scratch)

 
  Maybe also magicalize the back-end too, or be able to configure your models and having a general clean code generated that has
  validations, pagination for CRUD endpoints for each model which could be easily developed upon, meaning it doesn't look computer-generated.
  
  If both of the front-end/back-end CRUD points were automated, maybe a UI(Admin-like) could be developed for kickstaring/managing(?) a project.
  
  Note: I'm pretty sure I've seen similar stuff done for this, could be made unique in some parts if the very likely scenario is true. All in all still a good challenge even 
  if usage is developer-owner only(me), more fun to use your framework to generate the CRUD then to make it for 1000th time :P.
